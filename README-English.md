  The application is a user interface developed in React that allows users to explore and get information about characters from the popular "Rick and Morty" series. Users can search for characters by their ID and add their favorite characters to a favorites list. In addition, the app offers a user registration section and provides detailed information about each character, including their name, species, origin, and episodes in which they appear. The interface is intuitive and easy to use, with a navigation bar that allows you to access different sections of the application, such as the character list, character details, favorites, and more. The main technologies used are React, React Router, Redux, PostgreSQL, Express and Sequalize.
